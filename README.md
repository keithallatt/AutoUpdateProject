# AutoUpdateProject

This project is aimed at creating an interface, consisting of a python script and JSON file, that creates a local copy of an online repository, to then act as a class loader to run Java projects. The script may be ammended to work for C/C++ or JavaScript or Python projects.

This project relies on the functionality of git through the command line. The unix command `git clone https://github.com/keithallatt/repo` clones the repository into a local git repository on the users system, and `git pull` is used to gather any updates and apply them in the local git repository.
